# Ask me anything!

Hello There!

Thanks a lot for getting in touch with me! This is my AMA.

I get a lot of questions by email. This way anyone can read the answer!
Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Money. Work. Life. Code. Whatever.

## Is Email still Ok?

Yes, its perfectly fine. But I am always on GitHub, and respond faster here. And with the amount of spam these days, its easy to miss an important email such as yours :neutral_face: !

If you prefer email, do not hesitate to drop your query either [publicly](mailto:rishi.pithadiya+ama@gmail.com) or [anonymously](mailto:rishi.pithadiya+anonama@gmail.com). I will post them here for you (redacting as much details as I can erring as a human).

Note: Much of this is automated with my mail filters, so the subject line will always be public (including anon mails).
